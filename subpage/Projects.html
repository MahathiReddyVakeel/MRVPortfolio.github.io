<p style="background-color:GhostWhite"><strong><I>Customer Experience Enhancement Application:</I></strong><a href="https://github.com/MahathiReddyVakeel/CustomerExperienceEnhancementPlatform"> Github Link</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Project primarily relies on JDK 17, Java, IntelliJ IDEA, H2 embedded Database, Thymeleaf template, Stanford NLP dependency, Spring Boot Web framework, Spring Boot Data JPA, H2 Database, Spring Thymeleaf, Apache Commons CSV, OpenCSV, Stanford CoreNLP, and its model.

<p style="text-align:justify">This paper proposes a study of "Customer Experience Enhancement Platform" commonly abbreviated as CEEP. This research focuses on the role that users' experience in the virtual world plays in influencing the success of modern businesses' e-commerce business. First, by means of the subsequent use of advanced analytics and predictive modeling methods and deeper into Googles practices in using customer feedback and sentiment analysis for the basis of predictive models. As mentioned before, the work also assesses the current knowledge of customer experience management, highlighting the loopholes and limitations in the field. The research follows a Waterfall SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) approach, consisting of three phases: the scheduling, development/execution, and testing/integration. In this study, we plan to analyze the http://bulkdiving.com built as well as the existing solutions and accordingly, develop and test the prototypes. Documentation led to transparency and taking account of the project goals. The Particular methods of data collection, reporting, and implementation being discussed in the subsequent sections of the research. The study reveals the following key findings: Customer experience becomes for many businesses world something important for success and life activity. Customer's ability to use digital technologies provides great opportunities, creating the need for brand recognition and ideal customer experiences to meet expectations. So, using FinTech like AI and big data, one can grasp the needs of customers and develop a new user-friendly interface. The "Customer Experience Enhancement Platform" targets improving the system by successfully incorporating various forms of data into predictive models. The integration of these data sources adequately does present critical issues, however. The studies have proved it that a precisely designed "Customer Experience Enhancement Platform" uses analytics for the monitoring of customer data, which can improve the overall experience offered to customers and eventually boost satisfaction among them. The piece showcases significance of sensing and assessing the mechanisms behind and the factors in front of that customer feedback and sentiment will be used in predictive modeling. This study is an addition to the existing knowledge in that it addresses the obstacles as well as economies of developing a “Customer Experience Enhancement Platform” in the current world of business that is centered on digital. Through the curating of Google's strategies and the review of existing literature, this study will offer helpful suggestions relevant to creating similar strategic platforms across different sectors. The article, as well, directs attention on consumer experience in the ongoing digital competition era and to the importance of personalized experience assisted by analytical concepts.</p>


<p style="background-color:GhostWhite"><strong><I>Predicting employee attrition:</I></strong><a href="https://github.com/MahathiReddyVakeel/Predicting-Employee-Attrition-Project"> Github Link</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The project utilizes IBM's HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset and employs various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Key tools and technologies include Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras for data analysis and model development.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Using machine learning methods, we hope to predict employee departures in this project. Employee attrition is a key problem for businesses because it may result in increased expenses and the loss of talent. We'll utilize IBM's HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset, which includes information on employees' job satisfaction, performance assessments, and demographics. To anticipate employee attrition, we will preprocess the data, investigate the attributes, and use machine learning techniques. Our objective is to create a model that can forecast employee turnover correctly and identify the important elements that contribute to it.</p>

<p style="background-color:GhostWhite"><strong><I>Nearby Hospital:</I></strong><a href="https://github.com/MahathiReddyVakeel/Nearby-Hospital"> Github Link</a></p>

<p>Hardware Requirements: An i3 Processor-based computer with 1GB RAM, 80GB Hard Disk, monitor, internet connection, and an Android device.<br>
Software Requirements:The project requires Android for the front end, Java for the back end, Windows 7 or higher, and Android Studio.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">A hectic lifestyle to cope with fast pace more and more people are facing health problems irrespective of the age group. Health care system has thus become an inevitable part of every family. Getting efficient and quick health care becomes a necessity; therefore, along with the generic approach there comes a need to adopt a parallel efficient and speedy approach known as Digital Medicine. It is an approach which can be adopted by hospitals to provide quick access to health care services provided by them. Such as online video conferencing, emergency alarm with critical form of medical condition or accidents; uploading of medical reports with security measures necessary while consultation, online medical prescription, scheduling appointment, information about nearest hospital and medicos, life remainder system to remind medicine intake timely. It is designed with an aim to facilitate faster and efficient communication between doctors and patients giving transparency to locations or distance where they are based while using the application. The proposed application is deployed on android based mobile phones connecting to the server managed by hospitals and uses GPS and GSM network for communication.</p>
